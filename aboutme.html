            <p class="standard-text">
               Dr. Kai Schwennicke is a theoretical chemist from California who is currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher and Lecturer at the University of Sydney. He received his B.S. from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2018. In 2024, he earned his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of California, San Diego under the supervision and guidance of <a class="link" href="https://yuenzhougroup.ucsd.edu/index.html">Prof. Joel Yuen-Zhou</a>. His doctoral research explored light-dressed matter systems with applications in Floquet engineering, topological chiral optics, and molecular polaritonics. 
            </p>
            <p class="standard-text">In July 2024, Kai joined the group of <a class="link" href="https://www.kassal.group/">Prof. Ivan Kassal</a>, where he currently researches the theory of analog quantum simulators. Concurrently, he teaches Chemical Physics at the University of Sydney.

            <h2 class="section">Hobbies:</h2>
            <p class="standard-text">
                Growing up in a sleepy beach town on the coast of California and being raised by two avid surfers, Kai was instilled with a love for the outdoors at an early age. When not in the lab or classroom, you can find him surfing at the beach or hiking a local trail. Kai currently lives in Sydney, NSW.
