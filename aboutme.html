In 2018, he recieved his B.S. in from the University of Califoria in Santa Barbara. In 2024, he earned is Ph.D. in Chemistry from the Universiy of California in San Diego under the supervision and guidence of  <a class=link href=https://yuenzhougroup.ucsd.edu/index.html>Prof. Joel Yuen-Zhou</a>. His dissertation explored light-dressed matter systems with applications in Floquet engineering, topological chiraloptics, and molecular polaritonics. At the start of July 2024, he joined the group of <a class=link href=https://www.kassal.group/>Prof. Ivan Kassal </a>. His current rearch is focused on the developement of analog quantum simulators. He also teaches statistcal mechanics at the University of Sydney.
